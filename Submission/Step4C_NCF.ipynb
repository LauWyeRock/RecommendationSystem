Since we are using neural networks to find relation between users and items, we can easily scale the solution to large datasets. Thus making this method better than item based collaborative filtering.\n","\n","NCF works by first representing users and items as vectors in a latent space. These vectors are then used to calculate a score for each user-item pair. The score is then used to predict whether the user will interact with the item. NCF is useful because it can learn non-linear relationships between users and items. This makes it a more powerful model than traditional matrix factorization methods.\n","\n","Reference: [https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders/blob/main/examples/02_model_collaborative_filtering/ncf_deep_dive.ipynb]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xSJsEA9ZNduh"},"source":["### Setting up the environment\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DczE5pqyNSe9","outputId":"1e233b65-b38d-450a-a40a-9dc6c67e60c6"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["--2024-04-02 09:03:15--  https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n","Resolving repo.anaconda.com (repo.anaconda.com)... 104.16.130.3, 104.16.131.3, 2606:4700::6810:8203, ...\n","Connecting to repo.anaconda.com (repo.anaconda.com)|104.16.130.3|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 93409434 (89M) [application/x-sh]\n","Saving to: ‘Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh.6’\n","\n","Miniconda3-py39_23. 100%[===================>]  89.08M   168MB/s    in 0.5s    \n","\n","2024-04-02 09:03:16 (168 MB/s) - ‘Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh.6’ saved [93409434/93409434]\n","\n","PREFIX=/usr/local\n","Unpacking payload ...\n","                                                                                                   \n","Installing base environment...\n","\n","\n","Downloading and Extracting Packages\n","\n","Preparing transaction: - \b\bdone\n","Executing transaction: | \b\bdone\n","installation finished.\n","WARNING:\n","    You currently have a PYTHONPATH environment variable set.
