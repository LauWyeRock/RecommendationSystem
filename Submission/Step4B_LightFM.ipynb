        "# **LightFM Understanding**\n",
        "LightFM is a Python implementation of a Factorization Machine recommendation algorithm for both implicit and explicit feedbacks\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a Factorization Machine model which represents users and items as linear combinations of their content features’ latent factors. The model learns embeddings or latent representations of the users and items in such a way that it encodes user preferences over items. These representations produce scores for every item for a given user; items scored highly are more likely to be interesting to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "The user and item embeddings are estimated for every feature, and these features are then added together to be the final representations for users and items.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for user i, the model retrieves the i-th row of the feature matrix to find the features with non-zero weights. The embeddings for these features will then be added together to become the user representation e.g. if user 10 has weight 1 in the 5th column of the user feature matrix, and weight 3 in the 20th column, the user 10’s representation is the sum of embedding for the 5th and the 20th features multiplying their corresponding weights. The representation for each items is computed in the same approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modelling approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $U$ be the set of users and $I$ be the set of items, and each user can be described by a set of user features $f_{u} \\subset F^{U}$ whilst each items can be described by item features $f_{i} \\subset F^{I}$. Both $F^{U}$ and $F^{I}$ are all the features which fully describe all users and items.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LightFM model operates based binary feedbacks, the ratings will be normalised into two groups. The user-item interaction pairs $(u,i) \\in U\\times I$ are the union of positive (favourable reviews) $S^+$ and negative interactions (negative reviews) $S^-$ for explicit ratings. For implicit feedbacks, these can be the observed and not observed interactions respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each user and item feature, their embeddings are $e_{f}^{U}$ and $e_{f}^{I}$ respectively. Furthermore, each feature is also has a scalar bias term ($b_U^f$ for user and $b_I^f$ for item features). The embedding (latent representation) of user $u$ and item $i$ are the sum of its respective features’ latent vectors:\n",

        "$$ \\hat{r}_{ui} = \\sigma(q_u \\cdot p_i + b_u + b_i) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "As the LightFM is constructed to predict binary outcomes e.g. $S^+$ and $S^-$, the function $\\sigma()$ is based on the [sigmoid function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SigmoidFunction.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "The LightFM algorithm estimates interaction latent vectors and bias for features. For model fitting, the cost function of the model consists of maximising the likelihood of data conditional on the parameters described above using stochastic gradient descent. The likelihood can be expressed as follows:\n",

        "- `NO_EPOCHS = 50`: Indicates the number of complete passes through the training dataset the model should make during training.\n",
