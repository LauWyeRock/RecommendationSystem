        "Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), which is an innovative algorithm based on deep neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation — collaborative filtering — on the basis of implicit feedback. Since we are using neural networks to find relation between users and items, we can easily scale the solution to large datasets. Thus making this method better than Item based collaborative filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "NCF works by first representing users and items as vectors in a latent space. These vectors are then used to calculate a score for each user-item pair. The score is then used to predict whether the user will interact with the item. NCF is useful because it can learn non-linear relationships between users and items. This makes it a more powerful model than traditional matrix factorization methods."
