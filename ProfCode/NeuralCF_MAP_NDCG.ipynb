It is a general framework that can be used to express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework.\n","\n","### How does it work?\n","\n","NCF works by first representing users and items as vectors in a latent space. These vectors are then used to calculate a score for each user-item pair. The score is then used to predict whether the user will interact with the item.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XeVQzx0PUoYguN2v3GG2y5hsiFrAFHm8\"></img>\n","\n","### Why is it useful?\n","\n","NCF is useful because it can learn non-linear relationships between users and items. This makes it a more powerful model than traditional matrix factorization methods.\n","\n","Since we are using neural networks to find relation between users and items, we can easily scale the solution to large datasets. Thus making this method better than Item based collaborative filtering\n","\n","There are more complex architectures of NCF, for more information please visit the following link\n","\n","*   https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-collaborative-filtering-96cef1009401\n","\n","\n","<font size=1> Content of the notebook is taken from the following repository: https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/main/recommenders </font>"],"metadata":{"id":"xDNS_hi9itoI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Setting up the environment (~4mins)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xSJsEA9ZNduh"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DczE5pqyNSe9"},"outputs":[],"source":["# This is only necessary for colab since it only supports python 3.10, but the library we are using only supports <= 3.9.\n","# Comment this section if you are running it on your local machine\n","\n","!sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/OpenSSL\n","!sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pyOpenSSL-22.1.0.dist-info/\n","\n","!wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n","!chmod +x Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh\n","\n","!bash ./Miniconda3-py39_23.5.2-0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -f -p /usr/local\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/')\n","!pip3 install pyOpenSSL==22.0.0\n","\n","# Installing the recommenders library.\n","# Ensure that you have python version <=3.9 when installing this.\n","!pip install recommenders[examples]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Importing Libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"YjXVT2U-Pf1t"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import sys\n","import os\n","import shutil\n","\n","# Pandas and Numpy is used for efficient handling of arrays.\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","\n","from recommenders.utils.timer import Timer\n","from recommenders.datasets.python_splitters import python_chrono_split\n","\n","# importing the dataset\n","from recommenders.datasets import movielens\n","from recommenders.models.ncf.dataset import Dataset as NCFDataset\n","\n","# Importing the NCF model class from the recommenders library\n","from recommenders.models.ncf.ncf_singlenode import NCF\n","\n","# importing the evaluation metrics\n","from recommenders.evaluation.python_evaluation import (rmse, mae, rsquared, exp_var, map_at_k, ndcg_at_k, precision_at_k,\n","                                                     recall_at_k, get_top_k_items)\n","from recommenders.utils.constants import SEED as DEFAULT_SEED\n","\n","\n","print(\"System version: {}\".format(sys.version))\n","print(\"Pandas version: {}\".format(pd.__version__))"],"metadata":{"id":"60ssvIbjPlpu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Loading the Dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"LueGX40FQLIU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We will be using the movielens dataset.
